<div class="hts-doc-section">1.2 Install and initial setup</div>
<div class="hts-doc-text">
Parts of this documentation is also available in the Tvheadend man page.
<p>
<dl>
 <dt>Starting Tvheadend
 <dd>
 If you already have Tvheadend up and running you can skip this part.
 <p>
 Command line options:
 <dl>
  <dt>-f
  <dd>
  Fork and become a background process (daemon). Default no.

  <dt>-u username
  <dd>
  Run as 'username'. Only applicable if demonizing. Default is to
  use the UID of 1 (daemon on most systems).

  <dt>-g groupname
  <dd>
  Run as group 'groupname'. Only applicable if daemonizing. 
  Default is to use the 'video' group. 
  If the 'video' group does not exist, GID 1 (daemon) will be used.

 </dl>


 <dt>Default configuration
 <dd>
 All configuration in Tvheadend is maintained via its embedded web
 server running on port 9981. Just point your browser to:
 <p>
 http://hostname:9981/
 <p>

 By default <b>everyone (also from remote hosts)is allowed full
 access to all features / settings</b> in the web user interface. If
 this is the first time you setup Tvheadend you are most encouraged to
 enter the web user interface, selected the 'Configuration' + 'Access Control'
 tab and make reasonable changes. Futher help / documentation can be obtained
 inside the web interface.

 <dt>Settings storage
 <dd>
  Settings are loaded/stored in $HOME/.hts/tvheadend.

 <dt>Logging
 <dd>
 All activity inside tvheadend is logged to syslog using log facility.
 Also, if logged in to the web interface you will receive the same log in the bottom
 tab (System log).


 <dt>Permission to access video adapters
 <dd>
 In order for Tvheadend to control video adapters on the system it
 must be granted access to those devices. Most systems have a 'video'
 group with write access to the video adapter devices. When Tvheadend
 is started as a daemon (if Tvheadend is installed from a distribution package
 this is most likely the way it is) it will change its primary group
 to 'video' in order to access these groups. If your system is configured
 in a different way you can either change the group membership of the
 video adapters (/dev/dvb, etc) or reconfigure the Tvheadend start up
 parameters.
 <p>
 If Tvheadend is started without the '-f' argument it will not demonize
 nor change its primary UID/GID. Rather it will run with the permissions
 granted to the user executing the binary. If that's the case you must make
 sure the current user is granted with access to the video devices.


 <dt>Open ports
 <dd>
 Tvheadend listens to the following TCP ports by default:
 <ul>
  <li>9981 - HTTP server (web interface)
  <li>9982 - HTSP server (Streaming protocol)
 </ul>
 There is currently no way of disabling these TCP servers, nor bind the services to
 specific interfaces or other ports.
 To limit access, please read the section about 'Access Control' 
 in the configuration chapter.

</dl>
</div>
<div class="hts-doc-chapter">2 Electronic Program Guide</div>
<div class="hts-doc-text">
Tvheadend has a built in Electronic Program Guide. The EPG is an in memory
database populated with all the information about events received from
the DVB networks or from XMLTV.
<p>
The EPG tab displays a filterable paged grid containing all the events
sorted based on start time.
<img src="docresources/epg.png">
<p>
<dl>
 <dt>Filtering (or searching)
 <dd>
 In the EPG top tool bar you can access four input fields.
 These are used to filter/search for events. The form uses implicit AND
 between the input fields. This means that all filters must match
 for an event to be displayed.
 <dl>
  <dt>[Search title...]
  <dd>
  Filter on the event title. The filter uses case insensitive regular
  expression. If you don't know what a regular expression is this means
  that you can type just parts of the title and filter on that too.
  (No need for exact matching).
  <dt>[Only include channel...]
  <dd>
  Only display events from the selected channel.
  <dt>[Only include tag...]
  <dd>
  Only display events from the channels which are included in the selected tag.
  Tags are used for grouping channels and is configured by the administrator.
  <dt>[Only include content...]
  <dd>
  Most DVB networks classify their events into content groups. This field
  allows you to filter based on content type.
 </dl>
 Thus, if you only would like to browse Movies from your HD-channels you
 would select 'HD channels' in the [Only include tag...]-field, and select
 'Movie / Drama' in the [Only include content...]-field.
 <p>
 Notice that you don't have to press a 'Search' button, the grid immediately
 updates itself as you change the filters.
 <p>
 If you would like to clear all filters, just press the [Reset] button.

 <dt>Paging

 <dd>
 In an installation with many (hundreds of) channels and full EPG feed from 
 both DVB and XMLTV there will be tens of thousands of events in the database.
 Therefore the EPG display employs a paging bar at the bottom of the grid.
 Use it to browse backwards and forwards in the EPG. It also displays the
 total amount of events matched by the current query.

 <dt>Event details and recording
 <dd>
 If you click on a single event, a popup will display detailed information
 about the event. It also allows the user to schedule the event for recording
 by clicking on the [Record program] button.
 <p>
 <img src="docresources/epg2.png">
 <p>
 To close the popup, just close it with the [X] window button.
 The popup is not modal and you can open as many detailed information popups
 as you want.


 <dt>Autorecordings
 <dd>
 Should you wish to record all events matching a specific query. (Record
 your favorite TV-show, etc) you can press the 'Create Autorec' button
 in the top toolbar.
 <p>
 A popup with details about the to-be-created autorecording rule needs to
 be confirmed before the rule takes effect.
 <p>
 <img src="docresources/autorecpopup.png">
 <p>
 The autorecordings can later be changed/deleted in under the
 'Digital Video Recorder'-tag. Use that editor if you temporary want
 to disable an autorecording or make adjustments, etc.
</dl>
</div>
<div class="hts-doc-chapter">3 Digital Video Recorder</div>
<div class="hts-doc-text">
Under the 'Digital Video Recorder' tab you can administer and list status of
individual recordings and configure rules for the automatic recorder.
<p>
To access the DVR tab you must be logged in sufficient access
credentials.
<p>
For general configuration of the DVR (such as where and how to store
the recordings, please see the DVR section in the configuration
chapter)
</div>
<div class="hts-doc-section">3.1 DVR Log</div>
<div class="hts-doc-text">
The DVR log displays a paged grid containing all scheduled, current
and completed recordings. The list is sorted based on start time.
<p>
Use the bottom toolbar (not displayed in this manual) to navigate
between pages in the grid.
<img src="docresources/dvrlog.png">
<p>
To see more details about a recorded event, just click on it and a pop
up will appear:
<p>
<img src="docresources/dvrlogentry.png">
<p>
In this pop up you can cancel a scheduled recording or abort a
recording in progress.  To close the pop up, just close it with the
[X] window button.
<p>
Once the recording is completed there will be a clickable link to the
recorded matroska file so you can download it directly from the
interface.
</div>
<div class="hts-doc-section">3.2 DVR Autorecorder</div>
<div class="hts-doc-text">
The 'Automatic Recorder' is used to create rules that will trig
automatic recording of events. You can use this to record you favorite
TV show(s), record all movies on a specific channel, etc.
<p>
It's also possible to create a recording based on a query in the
EPG. For more information about that, please read the EPG chapter.
<p>
<img src="docresources/autorec.png">
<p>
 The tags are listed / edited  in a grid. 

 <ul>

<div class="hts-doc-chapter">4 Configuration and administration</div>
<div class="hts-doc-text">

<p>
All configuration and administration of Tvheadend is conducted via the
built in web user interface.

<p>
To access the configuration tab (and its sub panels) you need Admin-access.
For details about access control, please see the 'Access-Control' section in this chapter.

<p>
Each subsystem of Tvheadend is configured via its own tab:

<p>
<img src="docresources/configtabs.png">

</div>
<div class="hts-doc-section">4.1 Access configuration</div>
<div class="hts-doc-text">

Setting up access control is an important initial step as the system initially is
wide open.

<img src="docresources/accessconfig.png">

<p>
When Tvheadend verifies access is scan thru all the enabled access control entries.
The permission flags are combined for all matching access entries.
An access entry is said to match if the username / password matches and the IP source
address of the requesting peer is within the prefix.
<p>

The access rules are listed / edited  in a grid. 

<ul>
 <li>To edit a cell, double click on it. After a cell is changed it
     will flags one of its corner to red to indicated that it has been
     changed. To commit these changes back to Tvheadend press the 
     'Save changes' button. In order to change a Checkbox cell you only
     have to click once in it.

 <li>To add a new entry, press the 'Add entry' button. The new (empty) entry
     will be created on the server but will not be in its enabled state.
     You can now change all the cells to the desired values, check the
     'enable' box and then press 'Save changes' to activate the new entry.

 <li>To delete one or more entries, select the lines (by clicking once on 
     them), and press the 'Delete selected' button. A popup
     will ask you to confirm your request.
</ul>

<p>
The columns have the following functions:

<dl>
 <dt>Enabled
 <dd>Make the entry participate in access control. If disabled, the entry
     is inactive.

  <dt>Username
  <dd>
  Name of user, if no username is needed for match it should contain a
  single asterix (*).

  <dt>Password
  <dd>
  Password to combine with user, if username is '*' (unused), the password
  should be the same.

  <dt>Prefix
  <dd>
  IPv4 prefix for matching based on source IP address.
  If set to 0.0.0.0/0 it will match everything.

  <dt>Streaming
  <dd>
  Enables access to streaming function. The 'streaming' access is enough to
  make Showtime (over HTSP) work.

  <dt>Video Recorder
  <dd>
  Enables access to all video recording functions. This also include administration
  of the auto recordings.

  <dt>Web interface
  <dd>
  Required for web user interface access. Also gives access to the EPG.

  <dt>Admin
  <dd>
  Enables access to the Configuration tab.

  <dt>Comment
  <dd>
  Allows the administrator to set a comment only visible in this editor.
  It does not serve any active purpose.
 </dl>

<p>
Let's also take a look at an example:
<p>
<img src="docresources/accessconfigexample.png">
<p>
First line gives clients originating from 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.0.255 network
access to streaming functions. Typically you would use this for your
local media players at home (All though Showtime can prompt for username & password
in its HTSP client)
<p>
The second line adds a user with world wide access who might want to modify
recordings, etc, perhaps from the job, or mobile phone.
<p>
The third line provide admin access to the 'admin' user. As an extra precaution this
user is only allowed to log in from the home network.
<p>

</div>
<div class="hts-doc-section">4.2 Channel configuration</div>

 <div>
 The channels are listed / edited  in a grid. 

 <ul>
  <li>To edit a cell, double-click on it. After a cell is changed it
      will flags one of its corner to red to indicated that it has been
      changed. To commit these changes back to Tvheadend press the 
      'Save changes' button. In order to change a Checkbox cell you only

      will ask you to confirm your request.
 </ul>

 <p>
 The columns have the following functions:

 <dl>
  <dt>Number
  <dd>Channel number. This is not used by Tvheadend internally, but rather
      intended to be used by HTSP clients for mapping to remote control
      buttons, presentation order, etc

  <dt>Name
  <dd>Name of the channel as presented in EPG and external interfaces.
      Changing name of a channel does not interfere with scheduled
      recordings etc.

  <dt>XML-TV Source
  <dd>Name of the XML-TV channel. If you have XML-TV enabled you can 
      select which XML-TV channel to obtain data from. By default 
      Tvheadend tries to match the name itself, but sometimes it might
      not match between the XML-TV source and the TV provider so in
      such cases you can change it yourself.

  <dt>Tags
  <dd>Each channel can be bound to a zero, one or many tags.
      The tags are used for multiple things and it's up to you how
      you wish to use and name them. Tags can be used to aid searching
      in the EPG if you have many channels. The tags are also presented
      in a Media player.

  <dt>Icon
  <dd>An URL pointing to an image representing the channel.
      The icon URL will be set automatically when importing data from
      XMLTV. This field allows the user to edit it manually.

  <dt>DVR Pre-Start
  <dd>Allows the user to specify an amount of extra time that should
      be prepended to a recording scheduled on this channel.
      In other words, if you type 5 here for a recording that is scheduled
      for 20:00 will start to record at 19:55. This setting overrides the
      Extra time before recordings DVR setting.

  <dt>DVR Post-End
  <dd>Similar to DVR Pre-Start this allows the user to add an extra
      amount of time that should be appended to a recording.
      In other words, if you type 5 here for a recording that is scheduled
      to end 20:30 will stop to record at 20:35. This setting overrides the
      Extra time after recordings DVR setting.

  <dt>Merge button
  <dd>If you have two channels that are actually the same you can
      press the merge button on one of the channels to merge that into
      another channel.  After the merge the channel you pressed this
      function on will be removed and all services connected to it
      will be added to the target channel.

  <dt>Add DVB Network by location...
  <dd>
  Pressing this button will popup a window that allows the user to select
  a DVB network based on location. The adapter will be populated with
  multiplexes from these networks and immediately start to scan for services.

  <dt>Map DVB services to channels...
  <dd>
  Pressing this button will start a process that scans all services on all
  multiplexes and tries to verify if the service is actually a working
  TV channel. If so, the channel will be created and mapped to this service.
  You can start mapping services to channels once all muxes have been 
  processed. Until then the option will be disabled.

  <dt>Adapter name
  <dd>
  You can change the display name for the adapter.

  <dt>Autodetect muxes
  <dd>
  The DVB transmissions contains information about other muxes available
  on the same network. If this checkbox is enabled, Tvheadend will 
  automatically create new muxes as it receives configuration for them
  via the DVB networks.

  <dt>Idle scanning
  <dd>
  When nothing else happens Tvheadend will continuously rotate among all
  muxes and tune to them to verify that they are still working. 
  If your adapter have problems with lots of tuning, try to disable this.

  <dt>Detailed logging
  <dd>
  If this is enabled, Tvheadend will log more information related to
  this specific adapter. You might wanna enable this if you have some
  kind of issues in order to better diagnose the problems.

 <p>
 A word about DVB adapters
 <p>
 A DVB adapter represents a piece of hardware attached to the system.
 DVB receivers with dual tuners will present themselves as two adapters
 to the Tvheadend application. Tvheadend support DVB-T, DVB-C and DVB-S
 adapters.
 <p>
 There is currently no way of adding a new adapter to Tvheadend when running.
 If a new adapter is plugged into the system Tvheadend needs to be restarted
 in order to detect it.
 <p>
 If Tvheadend has configuration for an adapter and the adapter is missing
 upon start-up the configuration will be left untouched in case the adapter
 will be back in the future. There is currently no way to remove configuration
 for a no longer present adapter.
 <p>
 Warning: Unplugging an DVB adapter (USB, etc) during operation (i.e when
 Tvheadend is running) can result in deadlocking the kernel USB subsystem,
 most likely requiring a system restart.
 <p>
 Warning2: Suspending a system is (from a USB driver perspective) equivalent
 to a unplug/insert event. Thus, suspending a system running Tvheadend
 with USB adapters is not recommended at the moment.
